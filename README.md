## 🧩 Key Frontend Principles

-   **Semantic HTML5**  
    Clear document structure using meaningful tags (`header`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `nav`, `footer`) to improve accessibility and maintainability.

-   **BEM methodology**  
    Scalable and predictable CSS architecture using Block–Element–Modifier naming.

-   **Desktop-first responsive layout**  
    The layout is designed for large screens first and adapted for smaller viewports.

-   **Responsive images with `<picture>`**  
    Optimized image delivery for different screen sizes and resolutions.

-   **Accessibility-focused markup**  
    Logical heading hierarchy, readable typography, sufficient color contrast, and focus-visible interactive elements.
